            <p style="padding-top: 20px; font-weight: 600;"><b style="font-weight: 800;">Javascript</b> is a lightweight,interpreted <b style="font-weight: 800;">programming</b> language. It is designed for creating network-centric applications.It is complimentary to and integrated with java. <b style="font-weight: 800;">Javascript</b> is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross platform.<br><br><h3 style="font-weight: 400;">Why to Learn Javascript</h3><br><b style="font-weight: 800;">Javascript</b> is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in web development domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Javascript:
             <br>   
            <br>
            <ul style="font-weight: 600;">
                <li>Javascript is the most popular <b style="font-weight: 800;">programming language</b> in the world and that makes it a programmer's great choice.Once you learnt Javascript, it helps you developing great front-end as well as back-end softwares using different javascript based frameworks like jQuery, Node.JS etc.</li>
            <br>
            <li>JavaScript has many uses that go beyond its traditional internet roles. It powers smart televisions, works with the internet of things (IoT), creates native apps for iOS and Android, and builds cross-platform desktop apps, to name a few.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Since it's already installed on every web browser today, JavaScript spares the rookies from the chore of setting up a development environment. Newcomers can just jump in and start coding. It's one of the most accessible entries into coding available, a value-add for beginners. There is also a large online community that offers support and advice. Also, JavaScript is an excellent tool for beginning programmers who want to expand their skill set into other languages. JavaScript supports valuable skills such as object-oriented, functional, and imperative styles of programming. Beginner developers, in turn, can apply these skills to any new language they want to learn, like Python, Java, or C++.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Not only is it a natural language to use, but JavaScript is also easy to pick up. JavaScript turns intricate details into abstracts, making things easier for the newcomer. Unlike the higher-level languages, JavaScript has more of a natural language feel to it.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Far from being a one-trick pony, JavaScript empowers a programmer to handle any aspect of app design. Do you want to do user-side (front-end) coding? You can do it in conjunction with Angular. Are you more interested in the server-side (back-end)? Bring Node.js into the mix and you can do that, too.You can also create desktop, mobile, and web apps with Electron, React Native, and React. If youâ€™re intrigued by machine learning, then JavaScript will help you there as well.</li>
            <br>
            <li>JavaScript is, without question, the default language of the internet. You need to look no further than your browser for proof since JavaScript was most likely used to develop it. Since browsers are a necessary part of any user's online experience, it's easy to see why JavaScript is so significant.</li>
            <br>
            <li>JavaScript is a top skill in demand by employers. According to the 2020 HackerRank Developer Skills Report, over 50% of hiring managers are looking for JavaScript skills. Yet, JavaScript isn't taught in standard computer science curriculums at universities. Learners have a better chance of learning JavaScript through a coding bootcamp or by watching online tutorials. The HackerRank report raise the fact that 1 in 3 hiring managers have already hired a bootcamp grad. Learning JavaScript commands a high salary. The average salary of a JavaScript developer is $111,069 per year (Indeed) in the U.S. and $82,786 per year in Canada (Indeed).</li>
